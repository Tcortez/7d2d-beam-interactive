# ScottyBot Integration

We are integrating with scottybot so that we will have better control over points.

When using beam interactive buttons we realized that sparks are extremely time consuming to aquire
and it was discouraging our viewers to interact with us. This integration give us the ability to use the chat bot currency that we can control and give more to our viewers when they run out or get low. There is no way for a streamer to give viewers sparks through beam interactive.
